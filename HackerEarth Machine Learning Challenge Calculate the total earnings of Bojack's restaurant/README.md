## Problem statement

In the distant country of Cordovia, a guy named Bojack runs a prestigious restaurant. Although his restaurant has been receiving high volumes of advance-bookings for all tables recently, it has not been generating enough revenue as one may anticipate. He suspects his chief accountant, Todd Savez, is misreporting the total amount of bills that are generated.

For this, Bojack needs an automated system that can read the total amount from a given bill so he can later use it to check against the total earnings of his restaurant. Your task is to make a sophisticated NLP-based Machine Learning model that can process an invoice or receipt and output the total amount mentioned in it.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of files carrying receipt details from the restaurant.

The benefits of practicing this problem by using Machine Learning techniques are as follows:

This challenge will encourage you to apply your Machine Learning skills to build models that can process a receipt and output the total amount mentioned in it.
This challenge will help you enhance your knowledge of Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is one of the advanced fields of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
We challenge you to build a model that determines the total amount of an invoice generated in the restaurant.
